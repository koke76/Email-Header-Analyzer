Email headers contain valuable data that helps security analysts detect spoofing, phishing, and other malicious activities.
While this tool doesn’t detect malware directly, it provides crucial information that aids deeper investigations.

Future Improvements
Add attachment scanning or link analysis.

Integrate with antivirus APIs.

Develop a web or GUI version for easier use.

Add more sophisticated heuristics for phishing detection.
