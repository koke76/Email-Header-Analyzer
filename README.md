# Email-Header-Analyzer
About Me
Hello! I’m FARHAT Khalifa, a passionate Cybersecurity student and enthusiast eager to explore and learn more about email security and threat analysis.
This project is part of my journey to understand how emails work behind the scenes and how we can analyze their headers to uncover important clues that help fight cyber threats.

This project was inspired by my learning journey in cybersecurity.
I wrote and tested the code myself to understand email headers and basic phishing detection.
Some parts were assisted by AI tools, but all logic and modifications are my own.

Project Description
The Email Header Analyzer is a simple Python script that helps extract and analyze important information from raw email headers.
It can detect sender IP addresses, trace email routing paths, and show basic metadata like From, To, and Subject fields.

Additionally, the script performs a basic check for suspicious keywords in the email body that may indicate phishing or malware attempts.

Features
Extract all IP addresses from the email header.

List all 'Received' header lines that show the email’s journey.

Display sender, recipient, and subject information.

Detect suspicious keywords like "malware", "phishing", and "ransomware" in the email body.

Simple command-line interface for easy input and analysis.

Why This Project?
Email headers contain valuable data that helps security analysts detect spoofing, phishing, and other malicious activities.
While this tool doesn’t detect malware directly, it provides crucial information that aids deeper investigations.

Future Improvements
Add attachment scanning or link analysis.

Integrate with antivirus APIs.

Develop a web or GUI version for easier use.

Add more sophisticated heuristics for phishing detection.
